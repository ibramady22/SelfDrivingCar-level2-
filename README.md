The project is a proof of concept self-driving car level 2 featuring
1-Lane Keeping, 2- Lane Departure 3- Blindspot
4- Emergency break 5- Collision Avoidance 6- Sleep Mode
7- Adaptive cruise control 8- Rain detection and Autowiper
9- Temperature detection and Auto AC
10- IoT Dashboard and Feature on Demand
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the project, we use "STM32F103C8-M3" as a microcontroller and Esp8266
HAL:
RPLIDAR R1, IR sensor, PIR sensor, DC-Fan, Servo motor, Rain sensor, tempeture sensor, ultrasonic, DC-Motors, LEDS.

MCAL:
GPIO, SYSTICK, UART, RCC, EXTINT, AFIO, ADC, TIM1, TIM2, TIM3.

TOOLS:
STMCUBEIDE, GIT&GITHUB, Understand
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
the project has room for more features Such as FOTA which is Firmware over the Air to update the system wireless and AutoParking feature and more
so that the Project is "Version 1.0.0'.
